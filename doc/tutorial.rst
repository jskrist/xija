The tutorial for Xija is under construction.

GUI fit example
--------------------------------------------

For the ACIS DPA the heating sources include:

* Sun (depends on sun pitch angle)
* Science Instrument Module translation position
* Instrument electronic power draw
* Nearby thermostatic heater element
* Thermal coupling to rest of SIM

These model components along with the predicted DPA temperature are
shown in the image of the GUI fit tool `gui_fit.py` which is shown
below.
